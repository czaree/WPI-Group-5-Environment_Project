          <h1>Climate Change</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="sub_content"> <a>According to National Geographic the
            definition for climate change is: climate change is a long term
            shift in global or regional climate patterns. A common misconception
            of climate change is that climate change and weather are one in the
            same. However that is not true. Weather changes are measured in a
            short period of time, like day-to-day or year-to-year. Whereas,
            climate change is measured on a longer period of time like 2000-2010
            compared to 2010-2020. Climate change also differs from weather in
            the areas that are measured. Climate change measures seasonal
            temperatures, rainfall percentage of an area, and wind patterns.
            Weather on the other hand measures short period temperature changes,
            wind patterns, and barometric pressure. </a>
          <p>Because of the common misconception that weather is climate change,
            most people do not know that weather is a part of climate change.
            When weather becomes unpredictable it is an effect of climate change
            in that area. Thus making it difficult for areas who are dependent
            on certain things like growing crops. If an area that is dependent
            on crops cannot grow crops because of unexpected temperature levels
            or rainfall levels, then that area is in danger of becoming one of
            the many areas where the people are starving. World hunger is an
            effect of climate change because of the unpredictable changes and
            the unpredictable intense weathers. For example hurricanes, floods,
            downpours, and winter storms. If there has ever been an unexpected
            change in weather patterns the most likely reason for it is climate
            change. </p>
          <a>A commonly thrown around question about climate change is: is
            climate change a result of human activities? Because of this
            question many scientist have started studying the Earths atmosphere
            and the reasons behind why climate change has been as impactful
            within the past two-hundred years. When studying scientist found
            that the release of products named fossil fuels and green house
            gasses are the reason that the progression of climate change has
            increased. Furthermore, because people have continued to release
            fossil fuels and greenhouse gasses climate change impacts have
            increased immensely within the past two-hundred years. Fossil fuels
            are natural gas, oil, and coal. They are mainly used in factory and
            c word for making things. Green house gasses, however, have been the
            major problem of the two. Green house gasses trap the heat from the
            suns rays within Earths atmosphere. Thus the reason for why global
            temperatures are rising and why major icy areas are melting. </a>

            <p>One major impactful worry is that climate change is actually
              dangerous to people. Because of the unpredictable nature of
              weather certain patterns of sickness have come to light. It has
              been known that the health of the public can be affected by
              physical, biological, and ecologic systems. But what happens when
              these systems are thrown off balance? </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Increased respiratory and cardiovascular disease </li>
              <li> Injuries and premature deaths related to extreme weather
                events </li>
              <li> Changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution of
                food- and water-borne illness and other infectious diseases </li>
              <li> threats to mental health </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Public Health is continuously going to be impacted by climate
              change until there is a change within human activities with fossil
              fuels and green house gasses. </p>
