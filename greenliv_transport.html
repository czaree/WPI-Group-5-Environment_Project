      <p>Travel and transport are the biggest contributors to global warming, making up 29% of the total greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere. Burning gas to power cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes causes significant damage to the environment as a whole. The combustion of petroleum-based products and similar fuels releases a great amount of carbon dioxide into the air. Passenger cars and other non-commercial personal vehicles such as trucks and vans are the greatest offenders. However, there are several alternatives which are both greener and often more cost-effective than using a car.</p>

<h3>Public Transportation</h3>
<p>Busses, subways, trollies, and other forms of transport are often the most accessible alternate forms of transport. Although it may be less comfortable, sharing the same mode of transport with the general public takes much less fuel to run as compared to a car for every one to three people who wish to move about. As long as the area is closely settled, public transport is a perfectly viable alternative to a passenger car. With the only requirement often being the purchase of a ticket or pass, it may also be a cheaper option than purchasing a vehicle.</p>

<p>Sharing a ride with others, though carpooling or a ride-share vehicle, may also be worth considering.
  Similarly to public transport, the more people there are in the vehicle, the less possible carbon dioxide is produced.
  Whether it be sharing a car with friends, co workers, or anyone else, as long as it is safe,
  it’s just a little more green than driving alone.</p>

<h3>On Foot</h3>
<p>Walking or biking places is another option for getting where you need to go.
  As long as the area is both accessible to pedestrians or bikes, and nearby,
  choosing to walk or bike may be a welcome workout for the legs.
  While they may take longer than other modes of transportation, walking and cycling are almost free to do,
  and aren’t able to produce any harmful pollutants alone.
  Every once in a while, consider taking someone along, and saving the earth from a bit of heat.
