      <p>For as long as humans have lived on planet Earth, we have always been innovating,
        pushing forward technology to further and further frontiers. Where there is a problem or inefficiency,
        someone can always be found trying to fix it.
        Our tendency to push everything we already know to its limits to make life just a little bit better has provided
        countless discoveries which allow humans to survive as long as we have.
      </p>
        <p>However, these actions often come with consequences. Since the dawn of more modern technology has arrived,
        the energy demand needed to fuel all of the machines ever built has only
        climbed higher and higher as the years go on. Many technologies also tend to
        produce massive amounts of waste and pollution, which is not thoughtfully disposed of.
      </p>
        <p>The way humankind currently survives and innovates is not sustainable.
        The earth is heating up, ice caps are melting, and natural resources are
        being depleted at an alarming rate. At this rate, it may feel like the planet
        itself will implode next week. In the face of such an enormous problem,
        what is the average person supposed to do?
      </p>
        <p>Every effort to save the environment, no matter how big or small, is valuable.
        Even if you only act small and locally, action is action. The most important part of
        living green is people taking action in large numbers. Start a conversation within your community,
        petition the local government to take steps towards more environmentally friendly policies,
        or even advocate for better day to day habits online. Every individual has unique needs,
        which may mean that you are not able to live entirely eco-friendly.
        As long as each person makes their best effort to do a better job than we have in the past,
        everyone's hard work will way off.</p>
